        In the following article, I will attempt to draw similarities between my change in environment from a quiet suburb in the capital of Canada to one of the most 
        vibrant and fast-moving cities in the world, aka the concrete jungle where dreams are made of, aka the Big Apple: New York City.

      When I was a kid, I was obsessed with the NBA. I was a LeBron bandwagon fan growing up; watching him dominate on the Heat with Wade and Bosh was 
      unlike anything I'd ever seen in my 8 years of existence. There was this particular stat that I thought was incredibly interesting: pace. 
      This metric measures the number of possessions a team averages per 48-minute regulation game. This stat gives in-depth insights into the playing 
      styles, both offensive and defensive systems of teams, and competitive advantages that stem far beyond the stat sheet.  

      The formula for calculating pace is:

      <div class="my-8 p-4 bg-gray-800 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto">
        <div bind:this={formulaElement}></div>
      </div>

      
      The way we interpret pace is straightforward. If a team has a Pace Factor of 100, their games typically feature 100 total possessions combined between both teams.
      The current NBA average is approximately 99.56 possessions per 48 minutes across all teams. Teams with higher pace factors engage in more possessions per game, indicating
      faster-paced play, while lower pace factors suggest more deliberate, methodical approaches to offense and defense.

      <div>
        By default, an easy takeaway would be simply the increased amount of shot opportunities. You can imagine Ottawa like an NBA team with a lower Pace Factor‚Äîa slower-paced team with a larger 
        emphasis on half-court sets and high-efficiency plays (the San Antonio Spurs come to mind). Life is comfortable, low stress, livable wages, decently low crime, overall quiet and comfortable. 
      </div>

      <div>
        When you contrast this to NYC, it's like a different planet. The pace in NYC is night and day compared to Ottawa. You are stepping onto a team with one of the top 5 Pace Factors across the whole league.
        On average, high-pace teams generate more possessions per game, creating additional opportunities to score. For example, the 2024-2025 Memphis Grizzlies led the NBA with 106.9 possessions per 48 minutes. 
        This draws a direct correlation with their league-high 18.8 fastbreak points per game. This further enforces the connection between more possessions equating to more shot attempts, particularly in transition, 
        where offensive efficiency peaks. This doesn't come without drawbacks: high tempo imposes physical strain not only on opponents but on the offensive team as well. In 2024, the Atlanta Hawks (3rd in pace) used their young roster's
        energy to fatigue older teams; this is evident in the average decline of 12.3% in fourth quarter shooting against them. However, this is true for the team applying the pressure as well. As a result of the fast-paced offense, increased turnover rates are a common 
        side effect. The 2024 Washington Wizards (4th in pace) committed 15.8 turnovers per game (3rd most), drawing a strong connection to their 21-61 record (worst in the league).

     >
     </div>

     If you take the stats at face value, the correlation between pace and win percentage in the 2024-2025 NBA season is weak. If you recall from high school, a correlation 
     coefficient of ~0.33 (0 is no correlation, 1 is direct correlation) still implies teams that play fast‚Äîso fast pace alone isn't a reliable indicator of success. 

     <div>
      That's it? 
     </div>

     <div>
      Well, in the name of confirmation bias, I will offer an alternative. I believe that a hybrid model that combines the pros and cons of playing fast and slow pace could be a practical compromise. 
      For example, the Denver Nuggets ranked 1st in fastbreak points (18.8 ppg) while maintaining a moderate 98.8 pace (Jokic did this). They selectively pushed tempo after defensive rebounds, generating 23.4% 
      of their offense in transition. Combined with a unicorn 7-footer in Jokic who has playmaking ability better than most Hall of Fame guards with lob threats, their offense can choose to be selective, tactical,
      and flexible in how they approach games. 
     </div>

     <div>
      You must be thinking that I'm typing in circles, but there is a clear takeaway here. Having high pace is a <s>good</s> great thing; through sheer effort and grit, you are able to create more opportunities for yourself and your teammates. 
      This is a lesson that can be applied much further than just the basketball court. This can be compared to joining an early-stage startup with a strong team. The environment is unlike any other; you are forced to learn and execute faster‚Äî
      this is equivalent to joining an NBA team like the Grizzlies with a much higher pace factor. However, pace factor is a double-edged sword: it tires both the offensive and defensive teams, and when tired, passes get lazier, shooting percentage falls, etc. 
      The best teams in the NBA balance tempo; they see it as a tool and not a lifestyle. In select scenarios, against select teams, they turn things up a notch.

      Conclusion
     </div>

     <div>
      My personal takeaway would be that I would much rather play on a high pace team than a slow one. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, but I believe that it is much easier to learn to slow down than it is to learn to speed up. 
      This is why cars are designed with 250km/h+ top speed limits when most of the time, you are cruising at about half that.
